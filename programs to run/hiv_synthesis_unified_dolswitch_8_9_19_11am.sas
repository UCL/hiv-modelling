* === ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

This is the unified hiv synthesis program for sub saharan africa.

All programs run on legion/myriad for presentations/publications will use this program.

When running to address a specific research question the only parts of the program that may differ from this core program are 
sections ENHANCEMENTS / INTERVENTIONS in 2020 and WHETHER TO KEEP GOING BEYOND 2020.  In addition the section PARAMETER VALUES SAMPLED 
can be replaced by reading an existing set of values for these.  

Proposed approach to new evaluations:  For example, consider the evaluation of 6 potential art strategies.  Suggest we use two approaches for the 
evaluation. 
1. (as currently programmed below as of 29 aug 2019) the reference (comparator) art strategy is option 0, for each run there is a possibility of 
each of the 6 alternatives as option 1.  Several evaluations for different questions can be evaluated simultaneously. A regression model of 
difference between option 1 and 0 (on some outcome such as incidence, DALYS, net DALYs) on the parameters relevant for each evaluation is fitted on 
the outputs to isolate the effects for each evaluation.  (an alterative to this that we could consider is to run 2 random "option 1s" for each run
rather than always run an option 0 (no new intervention)
2. all 6 options are run simultaneously for each model run (options 0 to 5), with no other interventions differing across these 6 options. The 
programming of other interventions means that we are able to consider this comaparison against a background of different future changes in other
interventions but, unlike in approach 1 above, these other interventions would be the same across the 6 options. 
This latter aapproach (2) is the approach we have been using for several years.  Running both approaches 1 and 2 will help us ascertain whether approach 1 
has potential to replace approach 2 in future.



* === ANDREW UPDATES

- consider:  rr_sw_age_1525 = 1.50
- consider: if 15 <= age1 < 18 and life_sex_risk = 2 and e < 0.010 then sw1=1 
			if 18 <= age1 < 20 and life_sex_risk = 2 and e < 0.010 then sw1=1 
			if 20 <= age1 < 30 and life_sex_risk = 2 and e < 0.010 then sw1=1 
			if 30 <= age1 < 50 and life_sex_risk = 2 and e < 0.010 then sw1=1 

			if 15 <= age1 < 18 and life_sex_risk = 3 and e < 0.10 then sw1=1 
			if 18 <= age1 < 20 and life_sex_risk = 3 and e < 0.10 then sw1=1 
			if 20 <= age1 < 30 and life_sex_risk = 3 and e < 0.10 then sw1=1 
			if 30 <= age1 < 50 and life_sex_risk = 3 and e < 0.10 then sw1=1 
  so highest newp in age group 15-25 women as in red_a_15w

- once we are happy with this program I will start to run it using both approaches 1 and 2 above - for approach 2 the first evaluation I will
  focus on is reg_option and art_monitoring strategy (use of measruement of tenofovir levels)

- some changes to testing cose at: if t ge 2 and date_start_testing <= caldate{t} and prep{t-1}=0

- change distribution of an_lin_incr_test and test rate plataeu

- introduction of eff_max_freq_testing and effective rate of other parameters so we can distinguish between values originally set and
values changed to after 2020

- inserted lines on prob_pregnancy_b = prob_pregnancy_base

- added lines: if caldate{t} > 2016 and 10 le age{t-1} lt 15 then prob_circ = (2016-mc_int)*circ_inc_rate etc

- round off some parameter values

- remove the &j from end of several variables created after the main model part as these dont need to be arrays I dont think

- question for loveleen: why is onart_iicu defined later after we have lines if onart&j = 1 or int_clinic_not_aw = 1 then do
  why not define it higher up ? I think code works as is so perhaps best just not to change 

- changed distribution of rate_choose_stop_prep 
- changed distribution of circ_inc_rate as not enough variation in prop circumcised by 2019 
- change so that all variable names with age ranges the age range ends with 4 or a 9 rather than a 5 or a 0

- define s_alive_w s_alive_m numbers of adults age 15+ (including over age 65)
- changed newp_factor to 0.25 * as prevalence outputs too high
- added in new variables to drop statement (&l drop statement) so that we drop these variables over time - was slowing the running down
- changed newp_factor to 0.5 * as prevalence outputs too high
- still dont know why some runs are not running

- changed from 100 to 10000 individuals to run on legion
- removed run2
- changed mulitplier for newp_factor = 1 *(  from 3 * as prevalence distribution was high
- saved base_rate_sw_ in keep statement and output file
- renamed cald_ as cald in output file
- changes made over past 2 days include as below
- some typos in s_ resolved 
- change to code for rred_a dependent on m15r ets
- small changes / additions to keep statement
- renaming of t_ variables so they match with renaming to s_ in proc univariate
- check that age gender balance in newp now seems to be working ok
- checked that prevalence of sw seems reasonable (but we should maybe consider sampling rate of stopping)


* === LOVELEEN UPDATES SINCE LAST SAVED
Updated code for art initiators
Added if statement to resolve error in log file: if s_s_w_newp>0 then cum_ratio_newp_mw = s_s_m_newp / s_s_w_newp
Added 'if xx gt 0' in multiple places to resolve errors in log file
Removed duplicates from proc uni (all prep_infected vars plus a few others)
Add in 'if t ge 2' wherever needed
Added s_hiv1549_ to keep statement
Addition to anc code. Please check 'LBM Aug19';


* === LOVELEEN NOTES TO SELF



* === ANDREW NOTES TO SELF

to do before starting testing in preparation for runs:

- sample rate of leaving sex work 

- vmmc needs to depend on age

- conceive of an additional average annual cost per hiv diagnosed person (without sv = 1) to help to improve all below: 
  incr_adh_2020 decr_hard_reach_2020 decr_prob_loss_at_diag_2020 decr_rate_lost_2020 decr_rate_lost_art_2020
  incr_rate_return_2020 incr_rate_return_2020 incr_rate_restart_2020 incr_rate_init_2020  decr_rate_int_choice_2020  

- consider extra costs testing sw - currently sw_test_6mthly_2020 intervention is assumed to cost only the cost of the extra tests 
- more generally, have included an annual cost for people with diagnosed hiv and sv ne 1 to improve cascade but have not included additional costs beyond
  unit costs for increased switch of increased viral load measure done, prep or circumcision - still no specific costs for lower newp / more condom use


- consider that cascade of care enhancements can be general or in sex workers only 


 







* ==== VALE NOTES TO SELF







* ==== DOCUMENTATION NOTES AND IDEAS


- new outputs:  AIDS death rate by CD4 at start of ART and ahd{t} in first period










* ==== GENERAL NOTES AND CONSIDERATIONS  

- note that the scale factor to scale up to a population of 10 million (say) will differ according to inc_cat
- perhaps need to scale up per run according to t_alive1565 

- abort early based on plausible gender-specific prevalence

- infected_prep applies for starting prep when in primary, but not when starting prep due to test sensitivity 

- take account of fact that in namsal it took longer than 1 year for people with > 1 million VL at baseline to decline to < 50
(but less time to decline to < 1000) - regardless of regimen - not sure that adding this will add anything but keep considering

- could add in possibility of greater rate of initiation of art in hiv+ people who are diagnosed but off art (pop_wide_tld) due to easier access
but will leave out for now to err on side of being conservative about the strategy

- for country calibrations will calibrate to past trend in pop size and hiv prevalence and then current values of the wide range of measures

- add sw modelling to this and run sex worker interventions at same time ? (include fsw interventions so this can show generalisability of sex worker 
modelling done in zim context) - or is it better to stick to country specific models for that ?  

- can use this exact multiple enhancements program in the context of specific country contexts

- when these runs are done can add new intervetnions to evaluate - but need to add only one new intervention at a time and add it to the overall 
number of runs - if try to add more than one change at the time time we lose the independent sampling of parameters

- what about the fact that the enhancements are a mixture of introducing new strategies and somehow enhancing the extent or effectiveness
of interventions already in place - I think OK so long as all sampling of enhancements is independent

- considered that some interventions can be time limited (esp hiv testing increases) - but decided to keep as is because may be problematic 
to assume a derease again in x years 

- conceive of an additional average annual cost per hiv diagnosed person (without sv = 1) to help to improve all below: 
incr_adh_2020 decr_hard_reach_2020 decr_prob_loss_at_diag_2020 decr_rate_lost_2020 decr_rate_lost_art_2020
incr_rate_return_2020 incr_rate_return_2020 incr_rate_restart_2020 incr_rate_init_2020  decr_rate_int_choice_2020  

- consider higher pr_art_init if diagnosed while on prep

- proposed options: (i) no improvements  (ii) improvements (incl cascade of care, prep, circumcision, condoms,  tld in all on art (can sample from each of the 4 
alternatives below), alternative monitoring strategies of tld art initiators, tld for all men (except if tested –ve and np=0, start tld if np goes >= 1) 
sample these)

- is it plausible that so people have very low adherence to prep and dont re-test within the 3 month period before re-starting (assume they will be 
instructed to take PrEP every day and if they have a break of x days they need to test again) ? 
- how will progress if want to do a new project on kzn ?  add back in demographics and c_score code from kzn 
- keep leigh and gesine involved
- at some point model effect of sti testing on sti ?

- for future consideration: how can prep programs for agyw in KZN assess if they are cost effective ?  consider:
a. proportion of (re-)starters testing +ve within 3 months (the higher, the more cost effective)  b. proportion of people on prep > 3 months testing 
+ve per 3 months (the lower, the more cost effective)  vary adherence, propensity to want to take, elig criteria (fsw only, >= 1 newp, >=2 newp, 
>= 3 newp), incidence in 2017 (which varies anyway), efficacy, predict ce from a, b, cost prep/visits (or will they be equal across KZN ?)
(this applies assing rdt for the first test - proportion of (re-)starters testing +ve within 3 months will vary with window period of first test)
explore metrics for how to monitor prep programmes

	* res_trans_factor now only considers nnrti - mar16 - to concentrate on key parameter
	castro, jain and yang papers suggest that rate loss for nnrti mutations is probably lower than we have assumed (rate loss 0.04 per 3 mths) so this should
	be reduced (in mar16). 
	if no changes are made in res_trans_factor then this leads to levels of tdr that are much higher than those observed.  We therefore
	need to consider higher levels of res_trans_factor (i.e sampling from 0.8-2 rather that a fixed value of 0.6 
	and therefore lower prob of mutations being transmitted and surviving) than before to compensate;
